1. Declaring data structures and functions related to objects is called creating a class. Class is the definition of an object.

2. Different from regular variable, member variable is only stored within class and can only be invoked by calling the object and related functions.

3. Member functions are called within a class. Regular functions are called outside the class. 
   Because self argument is reference to the object.

4. IS-A relationship. HAS-A simply uses cariables that are references to other objects, but IS-A means " A is a B type of thing".

5. Contructor is to create an instance of a class and initialize the state of an object.

6. def __inif__(self, <var>, ...). This is called only once during the lifetime fo an object.
